# üß† Patient Drug Persistency Prediction: Model Evaluation Report

## üåç Business Goal

ABC Pharma aims to predict whether patients will persist with their prescribed medications using demographics, clinical history, risk factors, and treatment behavior. This prediction enables physicians to personalize care and improve drug adherence, leading to better patient outcomes.

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- No missing values detected.
- Outliers found in:
  - `Dexa_Freq_During_Rx` (460 outliers) ‚Äî addressed via log transformation.
  - `Count_Of_Risks` (8 outliers) ‚Äî handled by clipping.
- Encoding:
  - Binary risk factors (Y/N) converted to 0/1.
  - Nominal categorical features label-encoded.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Target Distribution:**
  - Persistent: 1,289 (‚âà38%)
  - Non-Persistent: 2,135 (‚âà62%)
- **Risk Factor Counts:** Majority have 0‚Äì2 risks.
- **Age Insights:** Persistency is higher in older patients (75+).
- **Specialist Type:** PCP and OB/GYN associated with higher persistency.

Visualizations like count plots, pie charts, and bar graphs are available in the notebook and Streamlit UI.

## üîß Final Recommendation

- **Best Overall Model:** `GradientBoostingClassifier`
  - Balanced high accuracy and ROC-AUC.
  - Explainable with SHAP values.
  - Ideal trade-off between performance and business interpretability.

- **Baseline / Explainable Model:** `LogisticRegression`
  - Great for compliance reports and business presentations due to transparency.

## üß™ Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the classification performance by comparing true labels against predicted labels.

> **Note:** If you encounter feature mismatch errors during prediction (e.g., missing feature `"Risk_Osteogenesis_Imperfecta"`), ensure your test dataset contains the exact same features in the same order as used during model training.

## üìà What is the AUC Score?

The **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)** measures a model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between classes across all classification thresholds.

- **Range:** 0 to 1
- **Interpretation:**
  - 1 = Perfect classifier
  - 0.5 = Random guessing
  - > 0.8 = Good performance
- The ROC curve plots true positive rate vs false positive rate, showing trade-offs at different thresholds.

## üß™ Confusion Matrix (Gradient Boosting)

|               | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Actual 0**  | 574 (TN)    | 80 (FP)     |
| **Actual 1**  | 116 (FN)    | 258 (TP)    |

- **True Negatives (TN):** 574  
- **False Positives (FP):** 80  
- **False Negatives (FN):** 116  
- **True Positives (TP):** 258
